# Purpose of this repo
I was looking for a nice data science project - nice as in novel, helpful to humanity, ... - but didn't bother doing the classic "predict skin cancer from 50 trillion images using 17 GPUs" project.
So, the next best option was doing an analysis of the best show ever - the office - inspired by the probably best data science blogpost ever from The Pudding (see [link](https://pudding.cool/2017/09/hip-hop-words/))

## Features I was thinking of
- Which lines / words are most characteristic of different characters (e.g., Michael: "that's what she said")?
- Which characters speak the most words per season & gender?
- Is the episode rating (if available) a function of who spoke how much?
- Are there topic clusters of different shows (bonus)
